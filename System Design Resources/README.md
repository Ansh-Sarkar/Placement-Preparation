  # System Design 

- Tech Level:  
  1️⃣ System's overview like we will use this queue with DynamoDB and a scheduler with justification of why we are using this DB, SQS, SNS, multithreading, etc.  
  2️⃣ for SDE-1 equivalent positions, this level is somewhat rare
- Normal Understanding:  
  1️⃣ knowledge of dividing system & creating a rough DFD of system  
  2️⃣ knowledge of DB Schema creation  
  3️⃣ able to create problem-solving logic or not  
  4️⃣ Time Required: Just need some reading of artiles/notes, can be pursued parallely
- Great Resources:  
 1️⃣ [Grokking](https://github.com/lei-hsia/grokking-system-design/blob/master/README.md)  
 2️⃣ [Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/README.md)
